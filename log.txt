***********Log file: we'll be logging progress and actions undertaken through this project here***********
// Pablo Carmona Benito - Internship at AVS - Added Value Solutions. 7 mar 2022 - 7 jun 2022

7 mar - presentation and initial approach to the problem: retrieving pictures of a project from the folders containing project's information. Stages definition: version 1 must be able to find IMAGE files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .tiff ...); version 2 should be able to get also images included in other files (i.e. in a .pdf). *Some research is needed in order to assure this is possible.

8 mar - coding starts. Work'll be done using:
      · VS Code
      · DevC++
      · GitHub
      Some extra software needs to be installed: MinGW compiler and extensions for C/C++. Particularly, C++17 is needed, and the "filesystem" package from "boost" library

9 mar - permission achieved to install MinGW on AVS computer. Coding goes on (see sources.txt to find the references used). A program is created which allows to create new directories inside of another one.

10 mar - no progress is made on this task. Dedicated to Catalogue.

11 mar - coming to realize that MinGW version installed is an obsolete one: it doesn´t include C++17 version requirements neither boost library (thus nor filesystem pack.). As new permission must be asked, in the meantime, and also looking ahead to do some work at home, coding will be done on personal computer. No information from the Catalogue and projects will be moved outside AVS computer. Little progress, trying to install a valid compiler version.

14 mar - key found to being able to compile. New MinGW version installed (on PC) and filesystem detected as a namespace.

15 mar - research on .exe files in Windows and compilation process in VSCode. DevC++ not useful by now (although compilation is easier, compiler requires to add dependencies to its path, and it's not clear which directories in particular must be directed in path).

16 mar - made a safety copy of initial draft, and started working on a test program. Got to succesfully build (.exe) and run code.

17 mar - Some more catalogue work and minor advance in code. Succesfully created direcctories and obtained a path list of the current directory, using std::filesystem.

18 mar - successfully fulfilled coding tasks involved in V1. Code works properly. Code is to be arranged and cleaned. If on time, functional .exe will be generated.
         In order to the code to be more ordered, following modifications are needed:
         - Creating global variables to deal with needed parameters OR PREFERABLY creating functions that get those parameters and give them back properly edited
         - No library will be created by now, since it's an easy program, there'll be no more than 3 or 4 functions, and inserting and using libraries might be risky with executable or batch files. Also it's a pain for system migration.
       - successfully generated functional .exe program which works on Windows
